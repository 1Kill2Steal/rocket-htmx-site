# Rust Rocket + HTMX site
It's a work in progress without much functionality.
Made this project to test out how to work with Rust for websites using Rocket.
I could try using Trunk to make it a web application for the future (not guaranteed).

## Prerequisites
1. [Rust language w/ cargo](https://rustup.rs/) (rustup)

## To use the application
1. Run `cargo build` (You only need to run it once)
2. Run `cargo run` OR `cargo run --release`

## TODO:
- SQLite integration (when? I don't know...)
> progress: made hashing and salting functions
> made a functional struct for the HTML form
> made the database schema with sqlite3
> TODO: implement the rusqlite data sign in and log in systems

- A lot of UI Improvement
> boring, I don't know when I'll do it...

- Buying a real domain and hosting on it- (probably not soon)
