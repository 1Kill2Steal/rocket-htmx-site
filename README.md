# Rust Rocket + HTMX site
It's a work in progress without much functionality.
Made this project to test out how to work with Rust for websites using Rocket.

## Prerequisites
1. [Rust language w/ cargo](https://rustup.rs/)
- This project uses rustup nightly - `rustup default nightly`

## To use the application
1. Run `cargo build` (You only need to run it once)
2. Run `cargo run` OR `cargo run --release`

## TODO:
### SQLite integration
- TODO: implement the rusqlite data sign in and log in systems.

### A lot of UI Improvement
- Boring. I don't know when I'll do it...

### Buying a real domain and hosting on it- (probably not soon)
