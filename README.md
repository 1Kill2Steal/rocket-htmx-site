# Rust Rocket + HTMX site
It's a work in progress without much functionality.
Made this project to test out how to work with Rust for websites using Rocket.
I could try using Trunk to make it a web application for the future (not guaranteed).

## Prerequisites
1. [Rust lang w/ cargo](https://www.rust-lang.org/learn/get-started)

## To use the application
1. Run `cargo build` (You only need to run it once)
2. Run `cargo run` OR `cargo run --release`
