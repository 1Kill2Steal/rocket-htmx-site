# Rust Rocket + HTMX site
It's a work in progress without much functionality.
Made this project to test out how to work with Rust for websites using Rocket.

## Prerequisites
1. [Rust language w/ cargo](https://rustup.rs/)
- This project uses - **rustup nightly** - `rustup default nightly`

## To use the application
1. Run `cargo build` (You only need to run it once)
2. Run `cargo run` OR `cargo run --release`

## TODO:
- Implement the `rusqlite` functionality for the log in system.
- Implement a **private** and **secure** cookie (of the hashed password) to persistently store the session.
- Implement a **log out** system that removes the cookie.

### A lot of UI Improvement
- Boring. I don't know when I'll do it...

### Buying a real domain and hosting on it- (probably not soon)
